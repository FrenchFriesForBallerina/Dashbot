To communicate with Arduino, we are connecting Arduino to Jetson. 

To install Arduino software to Jetson, we visited the official repository to download the software: 
https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installArduinoIDE, and installed it.

## Pin connections
- RX communication: pin 19
- ground
- 5 V

## Communication
- IBusBM.h library for reading IBus data
