# Dashbot 

TODO for next year: 

- finish teleop keyboard:
  - turning (extract angular z from somewhere)
  - restore reverse function (turns out we had it previously, find it and implement into present code)

When teleop works fully:
- compile code and load it on Arduino so it runs automatically when Arduino starts
- combine remote control code and teleop code into one code and use remote control channels to switch between teleop/rc control mode  
- left wheel controller: check wiring (does't work properly so needs fixing)

Our second year project at Clevon academy is to make a bot that can move autonomously.
In our second years first semester we are going to make a bot that can be controlled from our computers using teleop.
In our second years second semester we are going to make the bot fully autonomous.
